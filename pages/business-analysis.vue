        Saudi Arabia notes a thriving retail sector (expected to grow at a CAGR of 7.1% during 2021A-26F), mainly driven
        by factors such as likely increase in presence of e-commerce platforms, growth in consumer/ household spending on
        essentials, strong B2B demand potential, growth in tourism, and government initiatives/ programs. In response to
        the surging demand, few leading market players are expanding presence. For instance, Abdullah Al Othaim Markets
        (retailer) opened 9 branches in the Kingdom in Q1â€™2022 and Geekay (entertainment retailer) and BFL (multi brand
        retailer) entered the market in Jun 2022.
